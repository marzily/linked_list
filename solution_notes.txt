Recursion

Break a problem down into smaller subproblems and then solve it.

- "Termination case/exit case" --> Do some simple thing.
- Otherwise rerun same problem for a smaller set of the data.


Big O - Theta Notation
      - Asymtotic Analysis (analyze as inputs approach asymtote of infinity)
      - consider time (how long to run)
      - space/memory consumption
