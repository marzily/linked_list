## Linked List Implementation in Ruby

Linked List written both iteratively and recursively.

To run tests:
* Clone repo
* From command line:
```
$ bundle install
$ rake
```


### Project Spec

This Linked List has the following functionality:

* `append` an element to the end of the list
* `prepend` an element at the beginning of the list
* `insert` an element at an arbitrary position in the list
* `includes?` gives back true or false whether the supplied value is in the list
* `pop` an element from the end of the list
* `count` the number of elements in the list
* return the `head` value at the beginning of the list
* return the `tail` value at the end of the list
* `find_by_index` finds the value at a numeric position
* `find_by_value` finds the position of the first occurrence of a value
* `remove_by_index` removes the value at the specified index
* `remove_by_value` removes the first occurrence of the specified value
* `distance` returns the distance between two nodes
